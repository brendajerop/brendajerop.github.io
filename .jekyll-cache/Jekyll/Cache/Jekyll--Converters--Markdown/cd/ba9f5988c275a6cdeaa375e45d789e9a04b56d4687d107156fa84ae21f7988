I"U<p>I worked on the second task that I had found, and it turned out harder than I thought it would. When a user is revision-deleted on a wiki and you query the user who made a certain revision using API:Revisions, it will return <em>userhidden:” ”</em> instead of user: <em>“brenda”</em>…so my task was to find modules which were affected by this and add a note about these hidden keys.</p>

<p>First, only admins can see which revisions have been deleted so I requested for permissions on testwiki to be an admin, then I made changes to a file and revision-deleted some parameters and then queried module Revisions to see which parameters were affected. I thought that was all until I found out that it wasn’t only module Revisions that was affected by these hidden keys. So I had to go hunting for these modules in the code…it turned out that there were 6 modules affected by the hidden keys.</p>

<p>Both of my PRs to the Wikimedia Commons Android app were merged! It was a pleasant surprise because I didn’t think much of them.</p>

<h2 id="demo-app">Demo app</h2>

<p>The project mentor finally replied that she loved my app idea and that I should include it in my proposal. She also sent me links that would be helpful in regards to design and refining my idea.</p>

<p>From the links she sent me and from the feedback she had given to another applicant who had created a demo app, I decided to change the layout of the demo app to a mobile layout. It be a better use of space since the app would not have a lot of content.</p>

<p>I then created mockup screens for the demo app to reflect the new layout.</p>

<h2 id="submitting-my-proposal">Submitting my proposal</h2>

<p>The project mentor said that we were required to create drafts of our proposal on Phabricator and have them ready by Monday the next week. I had a google doc which I had been filling in with details of my proposal since early in the application period so that was left was to copy it to Phabricator and polish it up. I copied the proposal to Phabricator and requested for feedback from the mentor.</p>
