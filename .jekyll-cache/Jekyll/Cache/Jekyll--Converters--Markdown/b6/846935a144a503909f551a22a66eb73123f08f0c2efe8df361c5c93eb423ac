I"¸<p>Itâ€™s the eleventh week of my internship and Iâ€™m in the third phase of my internship, which is working on a demo app that demonstrates the usage of more than one MediaWiki Action API module. The demo app Iâ€™ve been working on has the following features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lists the current dayâ€™s holidays and observances from Wikipedia.</li>
  <li>Allows searching for holidays of other dates other than the current date.</li>
  <li>Allows authentication into Wikipedia in order to add a new holiday.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>Wikipedia has a page for each date, whose title contains the month name and date number, e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_1">February 1</a>. The page for each date(letâ€™s call it a date page) has common sections which are <em>Events, Births, Deaths and Holidays and observances</em>. There may be other sections for special dates, but the sections Iâ€™ve mentioned are common for all date pages.</p>

<p>When the demo app is loaded, it uses Pythonâ€™s <em>datetime</em> module to get the current date. It then sends a request to MediaWiki Action APIâ€™s <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Parse">Parse</a> module to get the parsed html of the text in the <em>Holidays and observances</em> section, in the date page. The html is then edited to a uniform format for easy styling using a html parser known as <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">BeautifulSoup</a>.</p>

<p>When the search button is clicked and the user chooses a date to search for, the date page to be parsed is updated and holidays for that date are fetched.</p>

<p>The app also allows adding of new holidays. However, since all the known holidays are probably already on Wikipedia, new holidays added through the app are added to <a href="https://test.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holidays_and_observances">this page</a> on Test Wikipedia, which is <a href="https://test.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">a wiki for developers to test their code without breaking all of Wikimedia and blowing up the world</a>.</p>

<p>The page is protected so that only auto-confirmed users can edit it so adding new holidays will require logging in. The app uses <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Login#Method_2._clientlogin">API:Loginâ€™s</a> <em>clientlogin</em> action to authenticate the user into Wikipedia and if the login is successful, the user will be redirected to a page where they can add a new holiday. If the login fails, the user will get an alert that the operation failed, and the cause of the failure.</p>

<p>At the <em>Add holiday</em> page, there is prompt to enter the date of the holiday to add and the description of the holiday. A request to edit the page is sent through <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Edit">API:Edit</a> and if the addition is successful, the user is redirected to the homepage, where the holidays listed are for the date which a new holiday was just added to. Holidays added through the app are formatted in bold so as to differentiate them from the â€œactual holidaysâ€.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve just opened a pull request for the demo app so as itâ€™s is being reviewed by my mentor, Iâ€™ll spend the week drafting a step-by-step tutorial to explain its implementation.</p>
