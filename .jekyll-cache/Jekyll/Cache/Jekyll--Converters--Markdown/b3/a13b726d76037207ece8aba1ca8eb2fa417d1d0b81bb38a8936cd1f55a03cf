I"3<p>I just started the third week of my internship and it has been interesting so far. According to my timeline, I should improve the documentation of three API pages weekly but on the first week, I had done all the three pages by Wednesday. I’ll be honest that this was partly due to a fear of falling behind. I later realized that I had to learn how to moderate and take my time because while it’s important that I achieve my timeline goals, it’s also important that I produce quality work. Rushing through the tasks will only result in mediocre work.</p>
