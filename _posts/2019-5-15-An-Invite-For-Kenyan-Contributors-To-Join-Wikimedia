title: An Invite for Kenyan Contributors to Join Wikimedia
tags: [Africa Wikimedia Developers]
---

Early this year, I began contributing to Wikimedia. I later came across awmd-stats, a tool that tracks technical contributions from Africans to Wikimedia projects. AWMD stands for Africa Wikimedia Developers and it’s a community whose mission is to encourage more Africans to contribute to Wikimedia. The tool is one of the ways to support the mission.

## The awmd-stats tool

When submitting my details so that my contributions can be tracked by the tool, Derick Alangi(xSavitar), a maintainer of the tool and an active contributor to Wikimedia commented, “Thanks a lot for your contribution and welcome. You’re the first one from Kenya on this project. Keep it up :)”
I later agreed to be the AWMD Country Lead for Kenya and I just realized that until now, I have done absolutely nothing to bring more Kenyan contributors to Wikimedia. So through this blog post, my aim is to make you aware of how you can start contributing to Wikimedia and be part of the community.

## Clearing things up

So what is Wikimedia and is it in any way related to Wikipedia?

Wikipedia consists of a collection of free online encyclopedias which are available in different languages. When most people say Wikipedia, they actually mean English Wikipedia. There are other Wikipedias like French Wikipedia and German Wikipedia.

A wiki is a type of website that can be edited through the browser and more often than not, by anyone. A good example of a wiki is the English Wikipedia. Anyone can sign up on English Wikipedia and add or edit information.

A wiki engine is a software that powers a wiki, the same way a software like WordPress powers many blogs. The software that powers Wikipedia is called MediaWiki. It’s free for anyone to use and it powers many other wikis apart from Wikipedia. MediaWiki is open-source so anyone can contribute to its development and improvement. Wikis powered by MediaWiki will usually contain a “Powered By MediaWiki” branding at the bottom.

Wikimedia is the organization behind Wikipedia, MediaWiki and so many other projects. Wikimedia projects will usually contain “a Wikimedia project” branding at the bottom.

## How you can contribute to and be part of Wikimedia

What I love the most about Wikimedia is that it provides a platform for people with a wide range of skills to contribute. One can contribute through software development, documentation, translation, etc. This wiki page explains all the ways you can contribute to Wikimedia and it also contains information on how to get started.

After you’ve decided on a way to contribute, it’s important to join the community where you can introduce yourself to other members of the community, ask questions and receive announcements. A list of ways to get in contact with the Wikimedia community is available here.

If you are African, you should join Africa Wikimedia Developers(AWMD), which I mentioned earlier in this blog post. To learn more about how you can join AWMD, please go through this wiki page. If you still have questions after going through the page, you can always [email me](mailto:brendajerop2015@gmail.com) and I’ll be happy to answer any questions you have:)
