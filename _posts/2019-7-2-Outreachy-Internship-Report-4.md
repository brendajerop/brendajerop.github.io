I'm currently in the second phase of my internship, which is "Working on overview pages". Overview pages are pages which contain information not specific to an API module. This consists of general information about the API like the API's data formats and errors. 

Working on overview pages turned out to be more difficult than I expected. While working on module pages, there was a template to follow so it was easy to know which information belongs or does not belong to the page, and what order to follow. I didn't have to make any major decisions on my own. Just like in programming, there are so many ways to iterate over an array, but by putting into consideration factors like complexity, one can always narrow down to the best method. 

On the other hand, working on an overview page is like answering an open-ended question. You aren't limited to a pre-set format and each page presents unique challenges. There are so many ways the words could be phrased or the page could be structured, and there's really no wrong way to do it as long as it follows the documentation style guide. So most decisions are up-to you and sometimes it can be frustrating to be on the fence about two ways to do something. 

However I'm really grateful to have my mentor who provides a second perspective. So far with my mentor's help, I've worked on five overview pages bringing the total page count to nineteen. I hope to complete eight more pages  before I start working on the demo app soon and I'm really looking forward to it.
